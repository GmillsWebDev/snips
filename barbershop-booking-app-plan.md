## 1. Core Architecture

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | SvelteKit (SSR + client routing) |
| Backend / DB | Supabase (Postgres + RLS + Edge Functions) |
| Auth | Supabase Auth (email/password, magic link, guest flow) |
| Email / SMS / WhatsApp | Brevo (transactional + scheduled) |
| Payments (later) | Stripe |
| Hosting | Vercel or Cloudflare Pages |

---

## 2. The `shop_type` Model

Every shop registers with a `plan_type` that gates features and determines UI rendering. This single field drives conditional logic throughout the entire app — routes, components, and DB queries all branch on it. Adding new plan tiers later (e.g. `franchise`) is trivial.

| Value | Who it's for | What it unlocks |
|---|---|---|
| `solo` | Single barber, single chair | Simplified booking (no barber/chair selection) |
| `multi` | Shop owner, multiple chairs | Full staff management, per-barber schedules, chair assignment |

---

## 3. Database Schema

### `shops`
```sql
id                   uuid PK
owner_id             uuid → auth.users
name                 text
slug                 text UNIQUE        -- e.g. "cuts-by-dave" for public booking URL
plan_type            text               -- 'solo' | 'multi'
auto_accept          boolean DEFAULT false
booking_window_days  int DEFAULT 28     -- how far ahead customers can book
buffer_minutes       int DEFAULT 0      -- gap between appointments
timezone             text DEFAULT 'Europe/London'
logo_url             text

## 4. Booking State Machine

```
                    ┌─────────┐
        (created)   │ PENDING │
                    └────┬────┘
                         │
           ┌─────────────┼──────────────┐
           ▼             ▼              ▼
       ACCEPTED       REJECTED      (auto-expired
           │          (notify)       after X hrs)

               (by customer
                or owner)
     │

## 6. Supabase Edge Functions

| Function | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `on-booking-created` | DB webhook | Fire Brevo confirmation email, check auto-accept |
| `on-booking-updated` | DB webhook | Fire accepted / rejected / cancelled emails |
| `send-reminders` | Cron (daily 8am) | Find bookings in 24hrs, send Brevo reminders |

| `get-available-slots` | HTTP (called by frontend) | Compute open slots from rules, blocks & existing bookings |

---

## 7. Brevo Integration Points

| Template Name | Trigger | Recipient |
|---|---|---|
| `booking_confirmation` | Booking created | Customer |
| `booking_accepted` | Status → accepted | Customer |
| `booking_rejected` | Status → rejected | Customer |
| `booking_reminder_24h` | Cron, 24hrs before | Customer |
| `booking_cancelled_customer` | Cancelled by owner | Customer |
| `booking_cancelled_owner` | Cancelled by customer | Owner |
| `review_invite` | Status → completed | Customer |
| `waitlist_slot_open` | Cancellation triggers | Waitlisted customer |
| `new_booking_alert` | Booking created | Owner (if not auto-accept) |
| `guest_booking_link` | Guest books | Customer (magic link to manage booking) |

> All templates should use the shop's `brand_colour` and `logo_url` via Brevo dynamic params for white-labelled, branded emails.

---

## 8. Row Level Security Strategy

| Table | Customer can | Barber can | Owner can |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bookings` | Read/create own | Read assigned | Full access |
| `customers` | Read/edit own | Read | Full access |
| `services` | Read active | Read | Full CRUD |
| `barbers` | Read active | Read own | Full CRUD |
| `reviews` | Read all, write own | Read | Read + hide |
| `discount_codes` | Validate only | — | Full CRUD |

---

## 9. Solo → Multi Expansion Path

The `plan_type` flag on the `shops` table keeps expansion clean and requires no schema migrations:

| Phase | What changes |
|---|---|
| **Now (solo)** | Barber/chair selection hidden in UI. One barber & one chair auto-created on shop setup. Simplified admin dashboard. |
| **Later (multi)** | Toggle `plan_type = 'multi'` on the shop record. The same codebase unlocks barber/chair selection in the booking flow, per-barber schedule management, and staff login roles. |

---

| **4** | Customer Portal | Login, my bookings page, cancel/reschedule, booking history |
| **5** | Services & Schedule | Service CRUD, availability rules, blocked slots UI |
| **6** | Notifications | 24hr reminder cron, waitlist notify, all cancellation emails |
| **7** | Polish | Reviews, loyalty points, analytics charts, discount codes, calendar view |

## Notes & Decisions Log

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Auth strategy | Supabase Auth (email/password + magic link) | Built-in, integrates with RLS natively |
| Guest bookings | Yes — email + magic link to manage | Reduces friction for new customers |
| Default booking flow | Manual accept by owner | Gives owner control; auto-accept is opt-in per shop |
| Timezone handling | UK only (`Europe/London`) for now | Simplifies V1; can be made per-shop later |
| Price storage | Integer pence (e.g. 1500 = £15.00) | Avoids floating point issues |
| Slug | Per-shop unique slug for public booking URL | Allows white-label feel without custom domains |
| Plan gating | Single `plan_type` field on `shops` | Simple, no extra tables, easy to extend |

*Plan authored: 2026 — ready to build when you are. Start with Phase 1.*
